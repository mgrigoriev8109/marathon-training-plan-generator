## Overview 

This is an app which creates marathon training plans. This app embraces the philosophy that it's better to be undertrained than overtrained, and aims to prevent common running injuries by incorporating a slow consistent progression tracking time instead of mileage. 

Prior to using a plan generated by this app individuals should first consult their healthcare provider. The MVP version of this app makes the assumption that an individual is capable of running 2 hours of per week over 4 or 5 days. If you're not at this level of fitness then talk to your healthcare provider about undertaking something akin to the [Couch to 5k training plan](https://marathonhandbook.com/couch-to-5k-training-plan/).

## My Process

First, I created a mock using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), thinking about the design from a mobile-first perspective. Next I broke down the UI into components and subcomponents by keeping the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) in mind. After a couple iterations I found a version I was content with and numbered the components 1 through 9.

I named each component, and arranged it in the following hierarchy:

- App (1)
    - Title (2)
    - Description (3)
    - TrainingPlanGenerator (4)
        - DateSelection (5)
        - TrainingPlan (6)
            - TrainingPlanRow (7)
        - PlanToPDFConverter (8)
    - Footer (9)
